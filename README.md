This is an example implementation of a Skill using the Skills Async API.

The Skills Async API provides a way for developers to create more advanced conversation interactions with your Digital People, by allowing you to send and receive messages asynchronously.

This provides more flexibility than the REST-based skill API when you want to go beyond simple request-response interactions. Example applications can be streaming multiple messages in the same turn, or allowing the skill to send messages to the user proactively.

## Pre-requisites

- [NodeJS v18+](https://nodejs.org/)

## Run the server

```sh
npm install
npm run serve
```

- You can try making modifications and adding your custom code for handling the various API requests and messages in `src/api/handlers`.
- You can debug the app in vscode using the `app` debug configuration.

## Serve for use with Studio

Localtunnel may be used to generate a public web address for your locally-running Skill, allowing DDNA Studio to connect to your Skill from a live Digital Person.

Generate a URL with a personalized subdomain using the following command, and then use this URL to configure the endpoints in your Skill Definition.

```sh
npx localtunnel --port 5000 --subdomain your-unique-id
```
